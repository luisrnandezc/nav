# NAV Aviation - Flight School Management System

NAV Aviation is a comprehensive web-based management system designed specifically for flight training institutions. The platform integrates all aspects of flight school operations into a single, unified system that streamlines administrative tasks, enhances student tracking, and improves operational efficiency.

## System Overview

The NAV Aviation platform provides complete management capabilities for flight schools, covering academic programs, flight training operations, financial transactions, safety management, and administrative functions. The system is accessible through any web browser and works seamlessly on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Core Applications

### Academic Management

Manages course catalogs including various aviation programs such as Private Pilot License (PPA), Commercial Pilot License (PCA), and specialized training programs. Tracks individual subjects with credit hours and passing grade requirements, maintains comprehensive grade records with multiple test types and recovery options, and provides real-time monitoring of student academic performance. Instructors can submit grades and assessments, while students can view their academic progress and course materials.

### Flight Management System

Records detailed flight session logs with comprehensive evaluation criteria and tracks simulator training sessions for all simulator types used by the school. Manages structured evaluation forms that can be customized for different training phases and requirements. Each evaluation form includes specific criteria covering pre-flight procedures, flight maneuvers, emergency procedures, and advanced operational skills. Schools can create and configure their own evaluation forms to match their specific training programs and requirements. Manages aircraft fleet information and automatically pairs students with qualified instructors. All flight records can be exported as professional PDF reports.

### User Management

Provides secure access control and profile management for all system users. Supports three distinct user roles: students, instructors, and administrative staff, each with specific permissions and access levels. Maintains detailed profiles including aviation-specific information such as certifications, qualifications, and training records. Secure authentication ensures users can only access information relevant to their role.

### Transaction Management

Handles all financial operations for student accounts. Records all student transactions including payments, refunds, course fees, and material costs, organized by category: flight training, simulator training, materials, and other expenses.

Enables flight schools to maintain comprehensive safety records and compliance documentation. Manages voluntary hazard reports submitted by students, instructors, and staff. Includes automated risk analysis capabilities that evaluate reported hazards and identify potential risks. Each hazard report can be associated with multiple risks, and each risk can have multiple mitigation actions. Tracks the status of all mitigation actions and automatically updates report resolution status when all associated risks are mitigated. Generates detailed safety reports and maintains complete documentation for regulatory compliance and safety audits.

### Fleet Management

Tracks all aircraft in the school's inventory. Maintains detailed records for each aircraft including registration information, maintenance schedules, and operational status.
